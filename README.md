# Scalable Chat App

Welcome to the **Scalable Chat App**, a robust and scalable real-time chat application built entirely with TypeScript. This project demonstrates best practices in designing chat systems that can serve a large number of concurrent users, with a focus on reliability, maintainability, and performance.

## Features

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Instant communication between users with seamless message delivery.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration flows for user management.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle thousands of simultaneous users efficiently.
- **Group and Private Chats**: Create chat rooms for groups or have one-on-one conversations.
- **Message Persistence**: Chat history is stored and retrievable across sessions.
- **Typing Indicators**: See when other users are typing in real time.
- **Message Read Receipts**: Know when your messages have been seen.
- **Responsive UI**: Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new features or integrate with other services.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: TypeScript, React (or your chosen UI framework)
- **Backend**: TypeScript (Node.js/Express), WebSocket for real-time communication
- **Database**: (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) for storing user and message data
- **Authentication**: JWT or OAuth2 for secure user sessions
